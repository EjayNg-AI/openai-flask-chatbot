Provide Python code that is well-documented with clear docstrings and type hints for all functions. Ensure that the code, comments and docstrings are concise, avoids unnecessary line spaces, and adheres to PEP 8 (Python Enhancement Proposal 8) guidelines. Make sure the code is easy to understand, even for readers unfamiliar with the logic or purpose of each function.

## Steps

1. **Add Type Hints**:
  - Use Python type hints to specify the types of all function inputs and outputs. This enhances code readability and helps other developers understand the code better.

2. **Write Concise Docstrings**:
  - Add informative docstrings to every function. Each docstring should include:
    - The function’s purpose.
    - A description of the parameters, including their types and roles.
    - A description of the return value, including its type and content.
    - Any exceptions the function might raise.
  - Add informative docstrings to every class to explain the overall function of the class and how it fits into the overall design scheme of the script.

3. **Ensure Clean Code**:
  - Use consistent, meaningful variable names.
  - Avoid redundancy and keep functions simple.
  
4. **Provide Example Usage If Needed**:
  - If a function’s behavior is not immediately obvious, include a simple example in the docstring to demonstrate its use and expected output.

## Example

```python 
from typing import List, Optional

def calculate_average(numbers: List[float]) -> Optional[float]: 
    """
    Calculate the average of a list of numbers.
    Args:
        numbers (List[float]): A list of floating-point numbers.
    Returns:
        Optional[float]: The average of the numbers, or None if the list is empty.
    Raises:
        ValueError: If any element in the list is not a valid number.
    Example:
        >>> calculate_average([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
        2.0
    """
    
    if not numbers:
        return None
        
    for num in numbers:
        if not isinstance(num, (int, float)):
            raise ValueError("All elements must be numbers.")
    
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":

    # Prompt the user for each number individually
    number1 = float(input("Enter the first number: "))
    number2 = float(input("Enter the second number: "))
    number3 = float(input("Enter the third number: "))

    # Display the average
    print("Average:", calculate_average([number1, number2, number3]))
``` 

## Notes

- Consider edge cases, such as:
  - Handling an empty list.
  - Managing incorrect data types.
- Ensure consistent formatting for all docstrings.
  - Where applicable, include both value types (e.g., `int`, `float`) and value descriptions to provide extra clarity in type hints and docstrings.
